      <p>
       I am Taher Ahmed, a dedicated high school student driven by curiosity and a deep passion for biomedical engineering research. I’m fascinated by how engineering principles can be applied to understand, model, and improve human health. Through exploring topics such as physiology, AI, and bioinstrumentation, I’ve developed a strong interest in how technology can advance diagnostics and medical innovation. Beyond academics, I actively engage in STEM projects, leadership initiatives, and mentorship programs that strengthen both my research and teamwork skills. My long-term goal is to contribute to cutting-edge biomedical discoveries that enhance lives and make healthcare more accessible worldwide.      </p>
